# Hamburger Menu Project
This project demonstrates a responsive hamburger menu. 

## How It Works
When the hamburger icon is clicked, a menu with links will appear on the screen. When each link is clicked, the contents of the page will change to an image of the item clicked. 

To exit out of the menu, the user can click the menu icon again. The menu will slide off-screen, and will no longer be visible.
